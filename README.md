## Inspiration

It's always been a big problem for me to decide on what to eat due to my indecisiveness and looking through lists of restaurants via websites like yelp or delivery services usually overwhelms me, making it harder to make a decision. I decided to try and solve that issue to make it easier for indecisive people like me to choose a restaurant to eat in.

## What it does

It's like a dating app where you can swipe left to pass on a restaurant and swipe right if you like the restaurant and it will redirect the user to the yelp page where they can see more details on the restaurant.

## How we built it

I built the frontend using React with TypeScript and I used Tailwind CSS to style the website. For the backend, I used Express running on the Node runtime environment, where I connected to the yelp fusion API to retrieve a list of restaurants near the user.

## Challenges we ran into

Styling the website was a bit challenging as it was my first time using Tailwind CSS, but I ended up getting the look I wanted and found that Tailwind CSS very flexible and nice to use.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

I'm proud of connecting the backend to the yelp fusion API to retrieve a list of restaurants near the user's location and linking the backend to the frontend as that is essentially the backbone of the application.

## What we learned

Building this project, I learnt how to use TypeScript and Tailwind CSS, and I found them really fun to use! I alos learnt using a third-party APIs to GET specific data I wanted for my application as well as strengthen my React and Express abilities.

## What's next for Chew Finder

I am planning to create an algorithm to personalize the user's likes and recommend more relevant restaurants to them.
